    <h1>Murders of Karlov Manaor</h1>
    <p class="teamInformation">The team of Outlaws at Thunder Junction is full of, well, you guessed it ... OUTLAWS AND VILLAINS. These aint no regular outlaws running from the cops. No, these are the most dangerous of them all. Hailing from the Old West, these enemies of the state take the law into their own hands and won't be messed with. Is this your team of choice? You might want to say yes or watch your back.</p>
