What would the Magic: The Gathering world look like if it had its own sports league?

In the Magic: The Gathering universe, five plainswalkers and its up to the teams ability to shut them down.

# Steps
To achive this I will be using the Scryfall API https://scryfall.com/docs/api to retrieve the information on the plainswalkers and other prominant information for the leagues - Card art, Card names, Card descriptions, etc.

As you can see here we are able to access all the information about the plainswalker Jace.
