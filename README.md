What would the Magic: The Gathering world look like if it had its own sports league?

In the Magic: The Gathering universe, Ajani, Chandra, Jace, Liliana and Nissa, five of the most powerful Planeswalkers have taken control of multiple planes and it's up to those who inhabit them to take control back.

Inside Magic: The Gathering | The League, learn about who these powerful Planeswalkers are, see those who call each plane home.

# Steps

The game of Magic: The Gathering is a strategy based card game. There has been over 20,000 cards published for the game over it's 25 year existance. To recieve the data from each card, including names, card type, data about the card and much more. I will be using the Scryfall API (https://scryfall.com/docs/api). This API is the deepest API about Magic avaliable to the market. I will be using GET calls to reiceve the data. This will supply me with the data needed to create all the Planeswalker and Planes information.

# Initial site idea

The initial idea for the layout of this site is to create a league-wide collection of data that would represent what an American sports site entails. The teams, standings, home page with news and information of who the teams and players are.
