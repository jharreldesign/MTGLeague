    <h1>Bloomburrow</h1>
    <p class="teamInformation">Bloomburrow, a charming pastoral world full of anthropomorphic animals where no human has set foot on the plane. Those who dare to enter are instantly met with the transformation to a creature at random to an animal-shifted body to match its inhabitants. It is assumed that this team inherents abilities to the plane itself, but whether it is a natural magical enchantment, an artifact, mighty spell, a Calamity Beast of plane altering power, or the aftermath of some divine condition is unknown. The animal a visitor becomes is influenced by the native animals of their homeplane.</p>
